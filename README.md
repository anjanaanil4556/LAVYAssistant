# LAVY: Our Assistant
  Personal Assistant Using Python
  
                                        Lavy is the project that we've completed during last 3 weeks along with SheHacks by Tinkerhub Women In Tech. SheHacks introduced us to python and honestly speaking we fell in love with this language. Comparing to other languages like C,Java etc.. python is much easier and understandable to all levels of programmers. Our Personal Assistant have features including speech recoganition,speech to text conversion,greeting user,web browsing,time and date,weather updates...
